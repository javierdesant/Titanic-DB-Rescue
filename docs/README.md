# Stellar Voyage: Titanic DB Rescue

Welcome to *Stellar Voyage: Titanic DB Rescue*, a futuristic database project where your mission is to restore and optimize the database systems of the legendary Titanic Spaceship.

---

## 🚀 **Project Overview**
The Titanic Spaceship, a marvel of interstellar travel, has encountered catastrophic data corruption in its core database. As part of the Data Engineering Corps, you'll:
- Analyze and conceptualize the database structure.
- Develop SQL scripts to retrieve and manipulate data.
- Optimize the database for future challenges.

This project blends creative storytelling with advanced database management techniques.

---

## 📋 **Features**
- **Conceptual Modeling:** Analyze and design a robust database schema.
- **SQL Development:** Create, retrieve, and manipulate data using SQL scripts.
- **Programming:** Implement database-driven logic to solve interstellar problems.
- **Optimization:** Enhance performance for seamless spaceship operations.

---

## 🛠 **Technologies Used**
- **Database Management System (DBMS):** MySQL.
- **Programming Languages:** SQL.
- **Version Control:** Git, Gitflow & GitHub.
